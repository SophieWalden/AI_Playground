# AI Pacman Arena
#
# Fight a basic AI enemy to see who can get the most amount of pellets in a pacman style map
# Winner is whoever the highest after 300 turns or hits 50 pellets whichever happens first
#
# The board, your position, and your enemy position is passed into your next_move function
# All you have to do is return a valid direction to move ["left", "right", "up", "down"]
# 
# Do not use the print() function, instead use self.log to log both strings and tuples/lists
#
# You can block your enemy, make an algorithim that can beat this basic pathing agent
#
